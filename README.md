# LS-Dyna-Shock-Profile-Generator-
Hi, this is a LS-Dyna shock profile generator. It can generate both half-sine wave and square wave with slightly greater speed than Excel.:)
It would create an excel file in the directory where you run the code. To make it readable for HyperMesh, you will need to copy the content from the Excel and paste them to textbook.
Note: Please avoid the "0" of the 2nd column of first row.
